# Bug Report

### Expected Behaviour

Tell us what you wanted to do. If you think that everyone knows, what you expected (for example, if the program just
crashed), you can skip this section

### Actual Behaviour

Tell us what happened. If there is an Exception please attach it.

### How to reproduce the behaviour

Tell us how to reproduce the wrong behaviour of the program. If it's an error which has to do this the obfuscation
please **always** attach the configuration.
(To get the config open the obfuscator in GUI-Mode, goto `Config`, enable `PrettyPrint` and press `Build`)

### Possible fix

If you have no idea then you can just skip this section ^^
